Description: Gaussian Process posterior distributions are often difficult to sample from.  We offer a series of MCMC sampling methods that use the Metropolis algorithm to sample from posterior distributions that use a Gaussian Correlation function and an Exponential prior.  Essentially, our MCMC functions sample from the posterior distribution of the correlation hyperparameters in the gaussian correlation function.
